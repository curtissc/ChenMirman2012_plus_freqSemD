# ChenMirman2012_plus_freqSemD
Modification of (Chen &amp; Mirman 2012)[http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0027175]'s neural network models of lexico-semantic processing (see models 5 and 6).
These experiments added a word frequency element in the connection weights between layers and manipulated where sigmoid inhibition occurred--in the word layer, the semantic layer, or both.
